 Hue-Saturation-Intensity is a more natural way of thinking of colors
 than Red-Green-Blue.  When you see "pink" you don't think of it as
 mostly red with equal parts of green and blue added, you think of
 pink as a tint of red (saturation).  Similarly, gold is not red and
 green, it is a shade of yellow (intensity).

 Computer monitors use the Red-Green-Blue scheme because it is more
 convenient to implement electronically, but with the new generation
 of personal computer color adapters which give you hundreds of
 thousands of combinations of red, green and blue to choose from it
 can be difficult to find the exact color you want, especially if you
 have to use trial and error.

 The hsi2rgb procedure converts hue, saturation and intensity values
 between 0 and 1 into red, green and blue values between 0 and 2, and
 then converts these into the 0 to 63 range used by the VGA palette.

 HUE determines the basic color of a pixel.  As you vary the hue from
 0 to 1 the full circle of colors is traversed, starting with blue at
 hue=0 and continuing through cyan, green, yellow, red, magenta and
 back to blue again with hue=1.  (Actually, the blue corresponding to
 the "B" in RGB is obtained with hue = 2/3 + 1/4, basic red is hue =
 1/3 + 1/4 and green is hue = 1/4.)

 SATURATION determines the "purity" of a color.  A saturation of 1
 gives a pure hue and as you decrease the saturation the color becomes
 more and more gray.

 INTENSITY is the brightness of the color.  Intensity=0 will always
 produce black.  Intensity=0.5 will produce R,G,B values that are half
 of those produced by intensity=1, but they ratios between the R,G,B
 values remain the same.

 The basic formulas used to convert HSI to RGB are as follows:

 È = 2„H
 R = 1 + S sin ( È - 2„/3 )
 G = 1 + S sin È
 B = 1 + S sin ( È + 2„/3 )

 These give full-intensity R,G,B values between 0 and 2.  You must
 then multiply by the intensity and adjust to whatever range is
 needed.
