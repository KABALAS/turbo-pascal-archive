The LZH unit implements a fairly faithful port of an algorithm that was
written in C by Haruyasu Yoshizaki and Haruhiko Okumura. 

The Documentation on how to use the unit is pretty goodm the source code
is pretty much undocumented.

Included is a simple 1 file compression program as a demonstration
on how to use the LZH unit.
